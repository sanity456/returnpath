# Security

All contract data is public. Do not submit secrets, private documents, personal data, or private images.

Threat controls include bounded ASCII inputs, closed identifiers and model responses, prompt delimiting, exact consensus comparison, role checks, duplicate-state guards, content fingerprints where relevant, deterministic post-consensus algorithms, and no fund custody.

Residual boundary: It creates no return right, compels no merchant, moves no money, proves no custody fact, and assigns no liability.

Report a vulnerability privately to the repository owner before public disclosure.

## Corrected review controls

- Leader output is not trusted merely because a leader-provided digest matches an independently computed digest.
- Closed-domain leader output is canonicalized against the active frozen record in the validator and after consensus.
- Consensus output is canonicalized and rebound again immediately before state mutation.
- No shared permissionless fixed-cap operational registry is used.
- Active deployment evidence is valid only when source bytes, full ABI/schema, address, transaction, and commit-pinned links resolve to the same release.
